Simple class for writing msn bots using pymsn

The basic bot includes subscribe/unsubscribe support. 
Currently the subscription list is held in memory.


To write a bot extend MsnBot.Bot by providing a process method.
Your process method can call send_text_message to reply to the user who sent you a message or broadcast to send a message to all subscribed users.
See MyMsnBot.py for an example bot.
